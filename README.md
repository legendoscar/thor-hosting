# thor-hosting
This is a portfolio website for a cloud hosting company. 

I started working on this pet project to reinforce my skill with Node.JS, AWS storage and database services.
I also have a keen eyes on cloud hosting services so this project is very valuable to understand the industry.

NB: I am a back-end dev and used templates for this. I customize it to suit what I needed to do.
